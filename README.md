## How to run the program

- Each programming question has its own file
- Since there are 3 different programming questions, the files are:
  - Q1.py
  - Q2.py
  - Q3.py
- Each of these file has a function called main().
- And inside main(), there are named variables that will be used as an input to the function.
- You can change those named variables to your desired input.
- To run the program, you can write `python {file_name}` in the terminal
